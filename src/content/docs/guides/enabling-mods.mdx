## How To Enable Mods on a Palworld Server

To enable mods on your Palworld server, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Mods Folder:**
   - Access your Palworld server's directory on your machine or through your hosting provider's file manager.
   - Look for a folder named `Mods` or similar, where you can place your mod files.

2. **Download Mods:**
   - Find the mods you want to use on websites like Nexus Mods or the Palworld Modding Community.
   - Download the mod files to your computer.

3. **Install Mods:**
   - Extract the downloaded mod files if they are in a compressed format.
   - Copy the extracted mod folders/files into the `Mods` folder in your Palworld server directory.

4. **Configure Mod Settings:**
   - Some mods may require additional configuration. Check the mod's documentation or readme file for instructions.
   - Modify your server's configuration files (e.g., `Game.ini` or `GameUserSettings.ini`) to enable the mods. This may involve adding mod IDs or changing settings specific to the mods.

5. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your Palworld server for the changes to take effect and to load the mods.

6. **Verify Mods:**
   - Join the server in Palworld and verify that the mods are working as intended.

By following these steps, you can enable mods on your Palworld server to enhance your gameplay experience with custom content and features.
