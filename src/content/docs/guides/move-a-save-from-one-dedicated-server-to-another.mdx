## Moving a save from one dedicated server to another

To move a save from one dedicated server to another in Palworld, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Current Dedicated Server:**
   - If you're using a hosting provider, access your current dedicated server through their control panel or SSH.
   - If you're hosting the server yourself, make sure you have the necessary access to transfer files.

2. **Locate the Save Files:**
   - Find the `Saved` folder inside the Palworld server directory on your current server. The save files are located here.

3. **Copy the Save Files:**
   - Copy the entire `Saved` folder or just the save files you want to transfer to the new server.

4. **Access the New Dedicated Server:**
   - If you're using a hosting provider, access your new dedicated server through their control panel or SSH.
   - If you're hosting the server yourself, make sure you have the necessary access to transfer files.

5. **Transfer the Save Files:**
   - Using an FTP client or the file manager provided by your hosting provider, upload the save files to the appropriate directory on the new dedicated server.
   - The save files should be placed in the `Saved` folder inside the Palworld server directory on the new server.

6. **Restart the New Server:**
   - Once the files are uploaded, restart the Palworld dedicated server on the new server to load the new save files.

7. **Verify the Transfer:**
   - Join the server in Palworld and check if your save files have been successfully transferred.
