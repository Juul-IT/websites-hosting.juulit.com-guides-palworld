## How To Limit the Number of Players on a Palworld Server

To limit the number of players that can join your Palworld server at once, follow these steps:

1. **Access Server Settings:**
   - Locate your Palworld server's configuration files. These are typically named something like `Game.ini` or `GameUserSettings.ini`.

2. **Find Player Limit Setting:**
   - Look for a setting that allows you to specify the maximum number of players that can join the server simultaneously. This setting may be named something like `MaxPlayers`.

3. **Set Player Limit:**
   - Set the value of the `MaxPlayers` setting to the desired number of players. For example, to limit the server to 10 players, set `MaxPlayers=10`.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the configuration file with the new player limit setting.

5. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your Palworld server for the changes to take effect.

6. **Verify Player Limit:**
   - Join the server in Palworld and verify that the server is now limited to the specified number of players.

By following these steps, you can limit the number of players that can join your Palworld server at once, helping you manage server performance and gameplay experience.
