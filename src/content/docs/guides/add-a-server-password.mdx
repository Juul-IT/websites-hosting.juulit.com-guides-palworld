## How To Add a Server Password in Palworld

To add a password to your Palworld server and restrict access to authorized players only, follow these steps:

1. **Access Server Settings:**
   - If you're using a hosting provider, access your server settings through their control panel or configuration files.
   - If you're hosting the server yourself, locate the server configuration files on your machine.

2. **Open Configuration Files:**
   - Look for a configuration file named something like `Game.ini` or `GameUserSettings.ini`.

3. **Set the Server Password:**
   - Locate the setting that allows you to set a server password. It may be named something like `ServerPassword`.
   - Set a password of your choice. For example, `ServerPassword=yourpassword`.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the configuration file and close the text editor.

5. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your Palworld server for the changes to take effect.

6. **Join with Password:**
   - Inform authorized players of the server password so they can join your server.
   - Players will need to enter the password when connecting to your Palworld server.

By adding a server password, you can restrict access to your Palworld server and ensure that only authorized players can join.
