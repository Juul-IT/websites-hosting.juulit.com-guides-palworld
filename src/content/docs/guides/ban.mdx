## How To Ban Players from a Palworld Server

To ban players from your Palworld server, follow these steps:

1. **Access Server Settings:**
   - Locate your Palworld server's configuration files. These are typically named something like `Game.ini` or `GameUserSettings.ini`.

2. **Find Player ID:**
   - Obtain the Steam64 ID of the player you want to ban. You can find this ID using tools like SteamID.io.

3. **Add Player to Ban List:**
   - Open the configuration file and look for a setting that allows you to add players to the ban list. This setting may be named something like `BanList`.
   - Add the player's Steam64 ID to the ban list. Each ID should be on a new line.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the configuration file with the player added to the ban list.

5. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your Palworld server for the changes to take effect.

6. **Verify Ban:**
   - Join the server in Palworld and verify that the banned player is unable to join.

By following these steps, you can ban players from your Palworld server to enforce server rules and maintain a positive gameplay environment.
