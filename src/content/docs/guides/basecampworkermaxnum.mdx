title: Increase BaseCampWorkerMaxNum for More Camp Workers in Palworld
---

## How do I increase the value of BaseCampWorkerMaxNum to 20 for more camp workers in Palworld?

To increase the number of camp workers in Palworld, you'll need to modify the game's configuration files. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Locate the Configuration File**: Navigate to the Palworld installation folder on your computer. Look for a file named `config.ini` or similar in the game's directory.

2. **Open the Configuration File**: Open the `config.ini` file using a text editor.

3. **Find the BaseCampWorkerMaxNum Setting**: Search for the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting in the `config.ini` file. If it doesn't exist, you may need to add it. Look for a section related to camp workers or general settings.

4. **Change the Value**: Modify the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting to the desired value. For example, to set it to 20, your configuration file should look like this:

```config
BaseCampWorkerMaxNum=20
```


5. **Save the Changes**: Save the `config.ini` file after making the change.

6. **Restart the Game**: Restart Palworld for the changes to take effect. You should now be able to have up to 20 camp workers in your base.

Please note that modifying game configuration files can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or compatibility issues. It's a good idea to make a backup of the original `config.ini` file before making any changes.
