title: Increase BaseCampWorkerMaxNum for More Camp Workers
---

## How do I increase the value of BaseCampWorkerMaxNum to 20 for more camp workers?

To increase the value of `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` to 20 for more camp workers, you'll need to edit the game's configuration files. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Locate the Configuration Files**: Navigate to the directory where your game's configuration files are stored. This is typically in the game's installation folder or a separate configuration folder.

2. **Open the Configuration File**: Look for a file named something like `game.cfg` or `server.cfg`. Open this file in a text editor.

3. **Find the BaseCampWorkerMaxNum Setting**: Search for the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting in the configuration file. It may be under a section related to camp workers or general settings.

4. **Change the Value**: Once you've located the `BaseCampWorkerMaxNum` setting, change the value to `20`. It may look something like this:

```config
BaseCampWorkerMaxNum = 20
```


5. **Save the Changes**: Save the configuration file after making the change.

6. **Restart the Server**: Restart your game server for the changes to take effect. This will allow up to 20 camp workers to be active in the game.

Please note that modifying game configuration files can sometimes lead to unintended consequences or compatibility issues. It's a good idea to make a backup of the original configuration file before making any changes.
