## How To Configure Server Permissions for Different Player Roles on a Palworld Server

To configure server permissions for different player roles on your Palworld server, follow these steps:

1. **Define Player Roles:**
   - Decide on the different roles you want to create for players on your server, such as "Admin," "Moderator," and "Player."

2. **Access Server Settings:**
   - Locate your Palworld server's configuration files. These are typically named something like `Game.ini` or `GameUserSettings.ini`.

3. **Set Permissions:**
   - Look for settings that allow you to define permissions for each player role. These settings may be named something like `PlayerPermissions`, `AdminPermissions`, and `ModeratorPermissions`.
   - Configure the permissions for each role according to your preferences. For example, you may want to give admins the ability to kick or ban players, while moderators may have the ability to monitor chat.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the configuration file with the permissions settings for each role.

5. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your Palworld server for the changes to take effect.

6. **Verify Permissions:**
   - Join the server in Palworld with different accounts assigned to each role to verify that the permissions are working as intended.

By following these steps, you can configure server permissions for different player roles on your Palworld server, allowing you to manage and control player actions effectively.
