## Hoe To Set Up a Whitelist for a Palworld Server

To set up a whitelist for your Palworld server and control who can join and play, follow these steps:

1. **Locate Server Files:**
   - Access your Palworld server's directory on your machine or through your hosting provider's file manager.

2. **Create Whitelist File:**
   - Inside your Palworld server's directory, create a new text file named something like `Whitelist.txt`.

3. **Add Player IDs to Whitelist:**
   - Obtain the Steam64 IDs of the players you want to add to the whitelist. You can find these IDs using tools like SteamID.io.
   - Add each player's Steam64 ID to a new line in the `Whitelist.txt` file.

4. **Configure Server Settings:**
   - Locate your Palworld server's configuration files (e.g., `Game.ini` or `GameUserSettings.ini`).
   - Look for a setting that enables the whitelist feature. This setting may be named something like `bUseWhitelist`.
   - Set the value to `True` to enable the whitelist feature.

5. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the `Whitelist.txt` file and the configuration file with the whitelist settings.

6. **Restart the Server:**
   - Restart your Palworld server for the changes to take effect.

7. **Verify Whitelist:**
   - Join the server in Palworld and verify that only players on the whitelist can join.

By following these steps, you can set up a whitelist for your Palworld server to control who can join and play.
