## Moving a save from local to a dedicated server

To move a save from your local machine to a dedicated server in Palworld, follow these steps:

1. **Locate Your Local Save:**
   - On Windows, the save files are typically located in the `Saved` folder inside the Palworld installation directory. For example, `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents\My Games\Palworld\Saved`.
   - On macOS, the save files are usually located in `~/Library/Application Support/Palworld/Saved`.

2. **Copy the Save Files:**
   - Copy the entire `Saved` folder or just the save files you want to transfer to the dedicated server.

3. **Access the Dedicated Server:**
   - If you're using a hosting provider, you'll need to access your server through their control panel or SSH.
   - If you're hosting the dedicated server yourself, make sure you have the necessary access to transfer files.

4. **Transfer the Save Files:**
   - Using an FTP client or the file manager provided by your hosting provider, upload the save files to the appropriate directory on the dedicated server.
   - The save files should be placed in the `Saved` folder inside the Palworld server directory.

5. **Restart the Server:**
   - Once the files are uploaded, restart the Palworld dedicated server to load the new save files.

6. **Verify the Transfer:**
   - Join the server in Palworld and check if your save files have been successfully transferred.
