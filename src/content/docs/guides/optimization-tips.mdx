## Server Optimization Tips for Palworld

To optimize your Palworld server for better performance and reduce the risk of crashes, consider the following tips:

1. **Reduce View Distance:**
   - Lowering the view distance setting in your server configuration can reduce the amount of terrain that needs to be loaded, improving performance.

2. **Limit Entity Count:**
   - Reduce the number of active entities (such as animals, NPCs, and vehicles) in your server to lighten the server load.

3. **Optimize Mods and Plugins:**
   - Choose mods and plugins that are well-optimized and regularly updated to avoid performance issues and crashes.

4. **Use Batch Processing:**
   - Use batch processing tools to perform resource-intensive tasks during off-peak hours to reduce the impact on server performance.

5. **Monitor Resource Usage:**
   - Regularly monitor your server's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk space) to identify and address any potential bottlenecks.

6. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Perform regular maintenance tasks such as cleaning up unused files and optimizing database queries to keep your server running smoothly.

7. **Update Server Software:**
   - Keep your Palworld server software up to date with the latest patches and updates to ensure optimal performance and security.

8. **Use Hardware Acceleration:**
   - If your server supports it, enable hardware acceleration for tasks that can benefit from it, such as graphics rendering.

9. **Limit Background Processes:**
   - Avoid running unnecessary background processes on your server that can consume resources needed for Palworld.

10. **Optimize Network Settings:**
    - Configure your server's network settings to ensure optimal performance and reduce latency for players.

By following these optimization tips, you can improve the performance of your Palworld server and reduce the risk of crashes, providing a better gameplay experience for your players.
